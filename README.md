# news-app

This newspaper application was built with the Django web framework. It allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. Users can leave comments on posts. The authentication system uses a custom model, and allows users to reset their passwords via SendGrid email. We use Postgres for the database.



## Requirements

* Python (3.8)
* Django (3.1)


We highly recommend and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.
